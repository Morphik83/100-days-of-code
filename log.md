# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10/06/2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
Alg: Level Order Traversal 
- hints: add node to search queue, use levelsize + while within while (while search queue, while levelsize)
Alg: Merge Intervals
- hints: 6 cases, better to sort on start, use class Interval(start, end)

**Thoughts** Its my another attempt to complete 100 days of coding. This time I'd like to improve on coding-interview skills.
